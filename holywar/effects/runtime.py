# This module defines functions for managing runtime state flags in the game engine. The runtime state includes information about the current phase of the game, which player's turn it is, and various flags that indicate what actions are currently allowed for each player. The `ensure_runtime_state` function initializes the runtime state if it doesn't already exist, while the `refresh_player_flags` function updates the player-specific flags based on the current game state. The `set_phase` function is used to update the current phase of the game and refresh the player flags accordingly.

# This dictionary defines aliases for effect actions. It maps various action names that might be used in card scripts or effect definitions to a standardized set of action names that the runtime will recognize and handle. For example, "add_faith" and "buff_faith" are both mapped to "increase_faith", while "remove_faith" and "damage_faith" are mapped to "decrease_faith". This allows for more flexibility in how actions are defined in card scripts while still maintaining a consistent set of actions that the runtime can process.

# These functions are utility functions for working with card definitions and their names. The `_norm` function normalizes a string by removing diacritical marks and converting it to lowercase, which is useful for comparing card names in a case-insensitive and accent-insensitive way. The `_card_aliases` function retrieves the list of aliases for a given card definition, which can be specified as a comma-separated string or as a list of strings. The `_card_name_variants` function generates a set of normalized name variants for a card definition, including its main name and any aliases. The `_card_name_haystack` function creates a single normalized string that contains the card's name and all its aliases, which can be used for substring searches. The `_card_matches_name` function checks if a given name matches any of the card's name variants.
