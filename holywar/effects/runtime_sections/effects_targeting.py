    # This method applies a specified effect to a list of target UIDs. It first normalizes the action specified in the effect and checks if it matches any known effect actions or aliases. Depending on the action, it performs the corresponding operations to apply the effect to the target instances. For example, it can increase faith, increase strength, grant attack barriers, prevent attacks, negate activations, grant extra attacks, equip or unequip cards, and destroy equipment. The method also checks if the effect usage can be applied based on the game state and ensures that any necessary conditions are met before applying the effect.
