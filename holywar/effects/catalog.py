# This dictionary defines the aliases for effect actions, mapping various alternative names to their canonical forms. This allows card scripts to use different names for the same action while still being recognized by the engine as valid actions. For example, "add_counter" can be used as an alias for "add_generic_counter", and "destroy" can be used as an alias for "destroy_card". This helps improve the flexibility and readability of card scripts while maintaining consistency in the underlying actions that the engine processes.
